# Time Bend

For people who want to get more done in their day, Time Bend is a productivity app that causes you to significantly cut down on time wasted procrastinating. Unlike other productivity apps, Time Bend actually works, and requires only a few minutes of investment per day.

This is a web app for Chetan Surpur's technique of time [time bending](http://chetansurpur.com/blog/2012/10/time-bending.html). Although he had built both a [website](http://timebend.me/) and [iOS app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/timebend/id525224894?mt=8&uo=4) for it, they have both been offline for several years now. As a result, I had built both a [cross-platform app](https://github.com/neelkamath/time-bend) as well as a [native Android app](https://github.com/neelkamath/time-bend-android) for the technique. I have decided to build it a third time for the following reasons.
- The cross-platform app is ugly, difficult to use, and has an unmaintainable codebase. It also doesn't render well in browsers because it uses Cordova, a framework for mobile applications.
- The native Android app doesn't run on iOS.
- I do not have the money, skills, time, or hardware to develop a native iOS app.
